## My Manifesto

India is not a democracy. India is a feudal country pretending to be a democracy. If it was a democracy, I would have been able to contest elections without having been a multi-millionaire or a film-star or the son of a multi-millionaire or a film-star. This is my dream, for my country - a manifesto of a simple-minded, frustrated, middle class citizen -

For our future -
 1. Overhaul our primary education system by decentralizing accountability
 2. Emphasize on physical fitness in schools, with Yoga as a mandatory activity for children
 3. Changing the Indian syllabus for middle, secondary and senior secondary schools
 4. Scholarships for college graduates who elect a voluntary teaching year after graduation
 5. Review the sufficiency categories for earning a PhD
 6. Indigenous defense manufacturing capabilities

 2. Relaxing state and union control over the police forces

 2. Zero government intervention into all religious institutions of religions originated in India
 3. Mandatory reporting of external funding of religious institutions and a clearance process
 4. Make India a secular nation and pass a constitutional amendment to restore the preamble

 2. Subsidize travel for the elderly, to select holy sites within India
 3. Provide small-farmers with drip irrigation in exchange for a portion of the produce
 4. Provide small-farmers with solar technology in exchange for a portion of the energy
 5. Strengthen the anti-exploitation laws for farmers who do not own land

For our independence -
 1. Establish reciprocity with nations funding mass media in India.
 2. Make states stakeholders in the countryâ€™s growth by an equitable distribution of needed natural resources, goods and services.
 3. Build and maintain server farms in India.
